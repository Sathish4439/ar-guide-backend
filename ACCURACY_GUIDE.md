# 🎯 Accuracy Improvement Guide

## ✅ What's Been Updated:

### 1. Confidence Threshold Set to 70%

Your server now **only shows detections with 70%+ confidence** or higher!

### 2. Configuration File Created

New file: `config.py` - Easy adjustment of all settings

### 3. Quality Presets Available

Choose from 4 presets or customize your own

---

## 📊 Current Settings (70% Confidence):

```python
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.7  # Only show 70%+ confidence
IOU_THRESHOLD = 0.45        # Non-maximum suppression
ACTIVE_PRESET = 'HIGH_ACCURACY'
```

**This means:**

- ✅ Only predictions with 70%+ confidence will show
- ✅ Fewer false positives
- ✅ More reliable detections
- ⚠️ May miss some objects (trade-off for accuracy)

---

## 🎚️ Available Presets:

### 1. HIGH_ACCURACY (Current - 70%+) ⭐

```python
ACTIVE_PRESET = 'HIGH_ACCURACY'
# Confidence: 70%
# Best for: Reliable detections only
```

### 2. VERY_HIGH_ACCURACY (80%+)

```python
ACTIVE_PRESET = 'VERY_HIGH_ACCURACY'
# Confidence: 80%
# Best for: Maximum reliability, critical applications
```

### 3. BALANCED (60%+)

```python
ACTIVE_PRESET = 'BALANCED'
# Confidence: 60%
# Best for: Balance between accuracy and detection count
```

### 4. HIGH_RECALL (40%+)

```python
ACTIVE_PRESET = 'HIGH_RECALL'
# Confidence: 40%
# Best for: Catching all possible detections
```

---

## 🔧 How to Change Settings:

### Method 1: Use Presets (Easiest)

**Option A: Edit config.py**

```python
# Open config.py and change this line:
ACTIVE_PRESET = 'VERY_HIGH_ACCURACY'  # For 80%+ confidence
```

**Option B: Quick change without editing:**

```bash
# Edit just the preset line
ACTIVE_PRESET = 'VERY_HIGH_ACCURACY'  # 80%+
ACTIVE_PRESET = 'HIGH_ACCURACY'       # 70%+ (current)
ACTIVE_PRESET = 'BALANCED'            # 60%+
ACTIVE_PRESET = 'HIGH_RECALL'         # 40%+
```

### Method 2: Custom Settings

Edit `config.py`:

```python
# Set custom confidence threshold
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.75  # 75% confidence

# Then set preset to None
ACTIVE_PRESET = None
```

## 📈 Confidence Level Comparison:

| Confidence | Accuracy   | Detections | Use Case               |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| **90%+**   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐         | Critical/Medical       |
| **80%+**   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐       | High stakes            |
| **70%+**   | ⭐⭐⭐     | ⭐⭐⭐     | Production (current) ✓ |
| **60%+**   | ⭐⭐       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐   | General use            |
| **40%+**   | ⭐         | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Testing/Development    |

---

## 🚀 How to Apply Changes:

### Step 1: Edit config.py

```bash
# Open in your editor
code config.py
# OR
notepad config.py
```

### Step 2: Change the preset

```python
# For even higher accuracy (80%):
ACTIVE_PRESET = 'VERY_HIGH_ACCURACY'

# For custom (e.g., 75%):
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.75
ACTIVE_PRESET = None
```

### Step 3: Restart server

```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
# Restart server
python server.py
```

### Step 4: Test

```bash
# In another terminal
python test_client.py
```

---

## 💡 Tips for Better Accuracy:

### 1. Increase Confidence Threshold

```python
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.8  # 80% - fewer but more accurate
```

### 2. Adjust IoU Threshold

```python
IOU_THRESHOLD = 0.4  # Lower = less overlapping boxes
```

### 3. Optimize Lighting

- Good lighting improves accuracy
- Avoid backlighting
- Consistent lighting conditions

### 4. Camera Position

- Clear view of objects
- Appropriate distance
- Stable camera (not shaking)

### 5. Model-Specific

- Ensure objects match training data
- Check if model was trained on similar conditions

---

## 🎯 Recommended Settings by Use Case:

### Security/Surveillance (80%+)

```python
ACTIVE_PRESET = 'VERY_HIGH_ACCURACY'
```

### General Object Detection (70%+) ⭐ Current

```python
ACTIVE_PRESET = 'HIGH_ACCURACY'
```

### Counting/Tracking (60%+)

```python
ACTIVE_PRESET = 'BALANCED'
```

### Development/Testing (40%+)

```python
ACTIVE_PRESET = 'HIGH_RECALL'
```

## 📝 What You'll See Now:

### Server Startup:

```
Loading YOLOv11x model...
✓ Model loaded successfully!

Configuration:
  Confidence threshold: 70%
  IoU threshold: 0.45
  Device: cpu
  Preset: HIGH_ACCURACY

Starting server on 0.0.0.0:3000
```

### During Detection:

```
[DETECTIONS] Found 2 objects (conf > 70%)
```

### On Client:

```
[DETECTIONS] Received 2 objects
```

All detected objects will have **70%+ confidence**!

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting:

### "No detections anymore"

- Confidence threshold too high
- Lower to 60% (BALANCED preset)
- Or adjust to 0.5 for testing

### "Still getting false positives"

- Increase confidence to 80% (VERY_HIGH_ACCURACY)
- Or set custom: `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.85`

### "Want to see all possible detections"

- Use HIGH_RECALL preset (40%+)
- Good for testing what model can detect

---

## 📊 Test Different Settings:

```bash
# Test 1: Current (70%)
# Leave as is, test

# Test 2: Higher accuracy (80%)
# Edit config.py: ACTIVE_PRESET = 'VERY_HIGH_ACCURACY'
# Restart server, test

# Test 3: Custom (75%)
# Edit config.py: CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.75, ACTIVE_PRESET = None
# Restart server, test

# Compare results and choose best for your use case
```

---

## ✅ Current Status:

- ✅ Confidence threshold: **70%+**
- ✅ Only accurate predictions shown
- ✅ Easy configuration via `config.py`
- ✅ Multiple presets available
- ✅ Ready to test!

---

## 🎬 Test It Now:

```bash
# Terminal 1 (Server):
python server.py

# Terminal 2 (Client):
python test_client.py
```

**You'll now only see detections with 70%+ confidence!**
